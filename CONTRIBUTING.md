# Contributing to the project
Thank you for you interest! Here are some key guidelines.

## PSR
We want to follow the latest actual [PSR](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/) standards.

## Tests are the documentation
The use cases and library's API must be expressed as tests. No logic must be written without a supporting test.
